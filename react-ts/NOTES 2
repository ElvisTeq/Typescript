## 1 Starting our React-Typescript project

---------------------------------- npx create-react-app ANY-NAME --template typescript

- Projects added to
  => "react-ts"

**\*** No need to manually convert our TS to JS **\***
=> no need to { npx tsc FILENAME }
=> Also it automatically does when { npm run build }
